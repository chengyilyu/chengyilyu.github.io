I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Leeds School of Business at University of Colorado Boulder. My research interests include stochastic modeling and optimization, approximation algorithms, online learning algorithms, and their applications in service operations, revenue management, and supply chain management. Previously, I received my M.S. in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research from the Pennsylvania State University, and my B.S. in Mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China.
